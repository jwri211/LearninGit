# It & Law Task 1 

## A privacy checklist to use when developing an IT system 

### Principle 1 - Purpose of collection of personal information
- [ ] When designing the software determine if personal information is needed for functionality.
- [ ] You may want more information about the users, clearly define what you need vs what you want.
> *For example, some websites need your name and email address to send you personalised information about their products. However, they may also ask for an address, to provide local products, or a phone number, for an added level of security. From the point of view of your product, what is needed to function, and what is optional?*

### Principle 2 - Source of personal information
- [ ] Get user to verify they are providing their own information through a checkbox or similar acknowledgement.
- [ ] Check that the information isn't being filled out automatically by other software, implement a 'Captcha' puzzle that's easy for humans to solve and hard for computers.
> *If your product is collecting personal information it needs to be from the individual themselves. Malicious software can look like a person filling out a form, so there should be measures in place to stop this.*  

### Principle 3 - Collection of information from subject
- [ ] Clearly explain to the user what information you are collecting from them when they first use your software.
- [ ] Provide the user access to a clear statement about what you're collecting from them, why and what for.
> *Users need to know what you are collecting from them. For example, they might know you have a name and email address because they have provided it. If you log any other information from their activities, they need to be informed and able to understand why you have it, what you do with it and other parties involved.*

### Principle 4 - Manner of collection of personal information
- [ ] Have you gained the information legally?
- [ ] Have you gained the information in a fair and unintrusive manner?
> *Software is not allowed to gain personal information through hacking or the use of malware, or against the permissions or knowledge of the owner. *

### Principle 5 - Storage and security of personal information
- [ ] Is a users personal account password protected against unauthorised access?
- [ ] Are there firewalls and antivirus measures in place to guard against malicious code and attacks?
>*When your software collects personal data from people you must take all reasonable steps to protect it from unauthorised access.*
