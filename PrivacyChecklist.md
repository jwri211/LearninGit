>*Some websites need your name and email address to send you personalised information about their products. However, they may also ask for an address, to provide   local    products, or a phone number, for an added level of security. From the point of view of your product, what is needed to function, and what is optional?*

</details>


### Principle 2 - Source of personal information
- [x] Get user to verify they are providing their own information through a checkbox or similar acknowledgement.

> *If your product is collecting personal information it needs to be from the individual themselves. Malicious software can look like a person filling out a form, so there should be measures in place to stop this.*  

</details>


### Principle 3 - Collection of information from subject
- [x] Clearly explain to the user what information you are collecting from them when they first use your software.
- [x] Provide the user access to a clear statement about what you're collecting from them, why and what for.

<details>
<summary> <i>More detail</i> </summary>  

> *Users need to know what you are collecting from them. For example, they might know you have a name and email address because they have provided it. If you log any other information from their activities, they need to be informed and able to understand why you have it, what you do with it and other parties involved.*

</details>


### Principle 4 - Manner of collection of personal information

</details>


### Principle 5 - Storage and security of personal information

<details>
